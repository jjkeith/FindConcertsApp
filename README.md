# Project3

Be sure to run the following when you're getting started:
`npm install --save body-parser bcrypt-nodejs connect-flash cookie-parser ejs express-ejs-layouts express-session morgan passport passport-local express mongoose`

If you add more npm's then please make a note of it here, so the rest of us can add them too.
